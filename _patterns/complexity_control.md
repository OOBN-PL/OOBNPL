**Version:** 1.0.0

**Pattern language family:** BN

**Modeling phase:**

    2. The conceptualization phase of a system of interest
    3. The technical implementation

**Modeling step:**

        6. Choice of estimation performance criteria and technique
        7. Identification of model structure and parameters' values

**Problem:**

BNs can become computationally intractable with the increase of their
complexity. A network complexity can be represented by the maximum size
of its CPTs. The size of a node's CPT grows exponentially with the
increase of the number of its parents and their respective states. The
network complexity can then be represented as:

$$max(CPT(d))= d^s \prod_{i=1}^{n} P_{i}^{s}$$

where: $CPT(d)$ is the size
of the CPT for a node $d$, $d^s$ is the number of states for a discrete
node $d$, and $P_{i}^{s}$ is the number of states of the *ith* parent of
node $d$.

***

**Solution:**

In order to decrease complexity we need to decrease the maximum CPT
size. This can be achieved by reducing the number of parents for the
nodes which CPT size surpasses a preset threshold, e.g.$2^{16}$. This is
done through:

- Application of the *Local dependence confirmation* pattern which
    entails excluding the parents that are highly correlated for the
    node under consideration.

- Applying node divorcing, i.e. grouping the parents that are
    logically related and adding a new latent node that acts as a child
    for each parent group. These latent nodes can then act as parents
    for the node with the complex CPT.

By applying this solution the size of the CPT for complex child node will be reduced as the number of parents will be decreased, hence the complexity of the network will
be reduced. A side effect for this solution is that the previously
complex node, e.g. node $y`$ in **Fig.1**, will be less sensitive
to changes in the originally parent nodes, e.g. nodes $X_1$ to $X_5$.

***

**Structure:**
The solution proposed by this pattern have the following structure in a
BN:

In **Fig.1** below, **N1** is the complex node before divorcing and **N2** is the less
complex network after introducing two latent variables, $A$ to group
${X_1, X_2, X_3}$ and $B$ to group ${X_4, X_5}$. $y'$ has a smaller CPT
than $y$.

**Constraints:**

This solution works under the following conditions:

- There should be a logical connection between the grouped parents,
    otherwise they cannot be grouped.

- As \"node divorcing\" adds intermediate nodes between parent nodes
    and child nodes, if the parent node is an intervention node,
    divorcing can \"dilute\" the impact of the intervention, i.e. reduce
    the sensitivity of the child to changes in the distribution of the
    parent.
