**Version:** 1.0.0

**Pattern language family:** BN

**Modeling phase:**

    2. The conceptualization phase of a system of interest
    3. The technical implementation
    4. QA/QC

**Modeling step:**

    5. Choice of how model structure and parameter values to be determined
    7. Identification of model structure and parameters' values
    9. Quantification of uncertainty

**Problem:**
Increased complexity of a node (increased number of parameters) due to being the child of several nodes. This happens when a variable has several possible causes. In this case the number of parameters for the node representing a variable $y$ that has $N$ parents:

$$T_y = S_{y} \cdot \prod_{i=1}^{N} S_{x_i}$$

Where:

$T_y:$ number of parameters to define for the node representing $y$

$S_y:$ The number of states for the variable $y$

$S_{x_i}:$ The number of states for the $ith$ parent $x_i$ of the variable $y$

***

**Solution:**
The solution for this problem is to do the following:

Describe the variable $y$ using a *NoisyOR* function with the parameters assigned to each parent $x_i$ representing the probability that this parent alone will cause the respective state of $y$. Then for each state of $y$ define a leak factor $l$ representing the probability that a latent variable (other than the parents defined in the model) is causing this respective state of $y$.

Applying this solution will reduce the BN complexity as the number of parameters for the node representing the variable $y$ will be reduced to:

$$T_y = S_y \cdot \Sigma_{i=1}^{N} {S_{x_i}} + S_y$$

***

**Structure:**
The structure for this solution is as follows:

**Constraints:**

The constraints for this solution are as follows:

- Each of parent variables should has a probability $p_i$ of being sufficient to produce the effect in the absence of all other parents.
- The parent variables are independent.
