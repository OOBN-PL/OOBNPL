The hierarchy of the OOBN PL is composed mainly of three layers. The first layer represents the model building phases, then, the second layer disaggregates these modeling phases into modeling steps. Finally, the patterns are presented in the third layer. Modeling phases and steps don not always have clear layers that separate them, therefore some of the steps will belong multiple phases. Similarly, some of the patterns will be belonging to multiple steps.The <span><a href="{{- site.baseurl -}}{%- link _pages/method.md-%}"><i>Methodology</i></a><span> adopted to develop the OOBN PL resulted in the following structure:
