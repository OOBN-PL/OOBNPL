A pattern language, in its essence, is the integration of two main components; a collection of patterns and a structure that connects these patterns in a unique arrangement. Here we describe the approach that was followed to determine both the PL structure and to compose the patterns included in it. The outcomes of the process described herein, i.e. the <span><a href="{{- site.baseurl -}}{%- link _pages/pl_structure.md -%}">PL structure</a></span> and the <span><a href="{{- site.baseurl -}}{%- link _pages/Patterns_gallery.md -%}">PL patterns</a></span> can be viewed in the respective pages.

The procedure that we followed to formalize the proposed OOBN PL is summarized in the following figure (**Fig.1**)

Patterns are composed over three steps:

- *Pattern mining:* in this step the pattern content is gathered from a relevant source, such as expert knowledge or documented knowledge.
- *Pattern writing:* in this step the collected knowledge is documented according to a predefined pattern anatomy.
- *Pattern symbolizing:* in this step the pattern is given a name and any necessary illustrations is added to the pattern so it can be easily understood.
