Models are increasingly used to help us tackle many of humanity's greatest challenges arising from complex social, economic, and environmental interactions. Such models are used for a multitude of purposes ranging from helping their users to understand the behavior of complex systems, informing decision makers and assisting them in devising effective policies, capturing the perspective of stakeholders and promoting their participation in the decision-making process, and fostering learning and education about different aspects of the complex systems. However, in order for these models to truly play the role expected from them, they need to demonstrate a high level of reliability and credibility, and their development process needs to be rigorous and transparent.

This work is motivated by recognizing the modeling workflow's importance and its role as a premise for the models' success. The modeling process in its entirety must be considered a fundamental component of the model itself. Therefore, having a clear workflow that delineates the design choices made by the model developer is key in understanding the model development process, reflecting on the design choices that guided it, and evaluating their impacts on the resulting model. Based on this view, we propose **OOBN PL (Object-Oriented Bayesian Networks Pattern Language)**, a pattern language that defines a modeling workflow for building Object-oriented Bayesian networks. OOBN PL utilizes patterns as structured reusable transferable containers of knowledge, where each pattern describes 

Object-Oriented Bayesian Newtorks **(OOBN)** is a versatile framework that is apt for addressing a wide range of the challenges related to developing complex interdisciplinary models.

An impactful PL is a one that motivates and provides a common basis for interdisciplinary communication between its different users. >>> <span><a href="{{- site.baseurl -}}{%- link _pages/contribute.md-%}"><i>contribute</i></a><span>.
