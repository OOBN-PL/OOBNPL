**Table 1**: The sections of the patterns included in the OOBN PL

| Section Name | Description |
| --- | ---|
| Name | A name by which the pattern can be referenced |
| Version | The version of the pattern so in the cases when the pattern is modified or updated, changes can be tracked |
| Pattern language family | The knowledge domain from which this pattern is extracted |
| Modeling phase | At which model building phase should this pattern be applied |
| Modeling step | At which model building step should this pattern be applied. Modeling steps provide more granular description of modeling phases |
| Problem | The context in which the pattern will be used and the problem it attempts to solve |
| Solution | The proposed solution for the problem |
| Structure | As the pattern language should be used to develop BN models, which are graphical models, this section describes the structure of the graphical model after applying the proposed solution. Additionally, for the patterns applying OOP solutions, this section includes a graphical representation of those solutions such as UML diagrams |
| Constraints | Any contradictory forces that need to be considered when applying the pattern|
| Related patterns | Other patterns that may be related to this pattern. The other patterns can describe other solutions related to the same problem, describe methods to handle the constraints, or can be applied in the same context but not for the exact same problem |
| Design Choice and model quality | This section represent the approach we follow to link patterns to model qualities (for more details please refer to the paper)|
| Resources | Description of the main literature resources that were used to inform the solution presented in the pattern |
